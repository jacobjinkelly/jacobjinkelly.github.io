A list of books I've enjoyed reading over the years, in the order I finished reading them.

Many of these books have had a tremendous impact on me. Whether they introduced a fresh perspective,
originally seeded an idea, or brought to my attention something I'd already been contemplating, I can trace
many of my core beliefs, patterns of thought, and overall worldview to reading some of these books.

My favourite books/ones which had an outsized influence on my thinking are in **bold**.
