## Online Courses

Ones for which I've completed a significant portion and really enjoyed.

- [Algorithms for DNA Sequencing](https://www.coursera.org/learn/dna-sequencing)
([*Ben Langmead*](http://www.langmead-lab.org/))
    - This course does a great job in motivating what otherwise might be dry material
    by linking it to applications in improving sequencing technology and impacting genomics.
- [Human Behavioural Biology](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL848F2368C90DDC3D&app=desktop)
([*Robert Sapolsky*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Sapolsky))
    - The best lecturer I've seen. He does an amazing job of crafting a narrative
    around the science.
- [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)
([*Andrew Ng*](https://www.andrewng.org/))
    - This course got me incredibly excited about machine learning.
    This course provided a solid foundation which I've relied on ever since to
    learn more about machine learning.
- [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn)
([*Barbara Oakley*](https://barbaraoakley.com/))
    - I originally learned about this course from [this article](http://nautil.us/issue/17/big-bangs/how-i-rewired-my-brain-to-become-fluent-in-math) by the instructor.
- [Introduction to Mathematical Thinking](https://www.coursera.org/learn/mathematical-thinking)
([*Keith Devlin*](https://web.stanford.edu/~kdevlin/))
    - I was really curious about what it actually meant to prove something in math
    and this course was a great introduction that improved my logical thinking ability.
- [CS50: Introduction to Computer Science](https://online-learning.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science)
([*David J. Malan*](https://cs.harvard.edu/malan/))
    - I loved the breadth of topics covered in this course; this was my first deep
    exposure to computer science and I got to learn about topics such as
    ciphers, sorting algorithms, hash tables, linked lists, and file I/O.
    The problem sets are excellent and give a sense of curious exploration.
