    <p>
    I'm an undergrad at the <a href="https://www.utoronto.ca/">University of Toronto</a>
    studying Computer Science, Mathematics, and Statistics.
    Currently, I'm a research student at Princess Margaret Cancer Research working in
    the <a href="https://www.pmgenomics.ca/bhklab/">Benjamin Haibe-Kains Lab</a>
    working on applying machine learning techniques to infer transcriptional networks
    from single-cell RNA-seq data, and on analyzing gene signatures for acute myeloid leukemia.
    <br><br>
    My research interests lie in the development and application of machine learning methods
    to problems in cancer biology, medicine and healthcare.
    In particular, I'm interested in latent variable models, learning models based on
    differential equations (e.g. Neural ODEs), optimization, information geometry,
    genomics and pharmacogenomics.
    <br><br>
    Some of my hobbies include running, rock climbing, and reading.
