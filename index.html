    <p>
    I'm an undergrad at the <a href="https://www.utoronto.ca/" target="_blank">University of Toronto</a>
    studying Computer Science, Mathematics, and Statistics.
    <br><br>
    Currently, I'm a research student in the
    <a href="https://www.pmgenomics.ca/bhklab/" target="_blank">Benjamin Haibe-Kains Lab</a>
    at Princess Margaret Cancer Research
    working on applying machine learning techniques to infer transcriptional networks
    from single-cell RNA-seq data, and analyze gene signatures for acute myeloid leukemia.
    <br><br>
    My long-term goal is to improve healthcare through technology. Towards this goal,
    I'm interested in researching how machine learning combined with novel sources of data
    can be used to develop new tools for improved diagnosis and treatment of patients.
    <br><br>
    More specifically, my research interests lie in the development and application of machine learning methods
    to problems in cancer biology, medicine and healthcare.
    In particular, I'm interested in latent variable models, learning models based on
    differential equations (e.g. Neural ODEs), optimization, information geometry,
    genomics and pharmacogenomics.
    <br><br>
    Some of my hobbies include running, rock climbing, and <a href="{{ site.url }}/bookshelf">reading</a>.
    <br><br>
    I'm always open to meeting new people, feel free to <a href="mailto: {{ site.email }}" target="_blank">get in touch</a>
    if you'd like to chat.
